        <h1>Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam's Biography</h1>
        <p>Great personalities are not born every day; they are born once in a century and are remembered for
            millennials to come. One such great personality that we will always be proud of is Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. His
            full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, born in Rameswaram of Madras Presidency on 15th October
            1931 and died on July 27, 2015, Shillong. He was an Indian Scientist and a politician leader, who later
            became the 11th President of India
            became the 11th President of India. He played an important role in the development of India’s missile and
            nuclear weapons program.

            It is an absolute honor for us to learn about his great leader in the form of his biography. Without much
            ado, let us start.
        </p>
        <h1>Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam's Biography - Kalam as a Scientist</h1>
        <p>Kalam joined as a scientist in the aeronautical development establishment of DRDO in 1960, after graduation.
            His career started with him designing a small hovercraft. However, he was not convinced by his choice of a
            job at the DRDO. Kalam was transferred to ISRO in 1969, where he was the project director of India's first
            satellite vehicle launch. The satellite vehicle deployed the Rohini satellite successfully in near-Earth
            orbit in July 1980. Kalam received the Government's LV and Slv projects between the 1970s-90s. He directed
            two projects like Project Devil and Project Valiant, which aimed at developing ballistic missiles from the
            successful SLV program's technology Kalam somehow convinced Indira Gandhi and sought secret funds for these
            aerospace projects. His research and immense knowledge brought him and the nation great laurels in the
            1980s.

        <h1>Kalam as the 11th President of India </h1>
        <p>
            Sir Kalam was entitled to be the 11th president of India. His term period of 25th July 2002 to 25th July
            2007 was achieved by winning a presidential election in 2002 with a massive margin of votes. National
            Democratic Alliances’ nominated him to be president and it was supported by Samajwadi Party and National
            Congress Party. He was lovingly called as peoples’ president as he had done uncountable works for the
            welfare of the people and through the entire country.

            He was brave and courageous enough to take decisions and implement them no matter if that was tough or
            sensitive or highly controversial. The “office of profit” is perhaps the hard Act that he had to sign. The
            “office of profit”, according to the English Act of Settlement in 1701 explains that no single individual
            who has a professional set up under the royal family, who has some kind of provision with or who is taking a
            pension from the prince has the right to work for the of the “House of Commons”. This will allow the royal
            family to have zero influence on the administrative conditions.
        </p>
        <h1>Kalam’s Works and Motivation</h1>
        <p>He was the writer of various motivational books like "India 2010", "Touched off Minds", "Mission India", "The
            Luminous Sparks", "Wings of Fire", and "Moving Thoughts".

            His life, work, and convictions are loaded up with models and motivations. He will keep on inspiring us for
            eternity. Furthermore, this is the genuine justification for why individuals from every one of the segments
            of the general public precipitously show love for this incredible person on his miserable end at IIM
            Shillong on 27th July 2015.
        </p>
        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>Abdul Kalam was elected as the eleventh president of India in 2002 with the assistance of the ruling
            Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-competition Indian National Congress. He is widely referred to as the
            "People's President". He spent four decades as a scientist and science administrator, especially on the
            <samp>Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)</samp>  and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), and
            became concerned with India's civilian space program and army missile improvement efforts.

            Abdul Kalam lowered back to his civilian lifestyle of schooling, writing, and public career after a single
            term. He received <samp>Bharat Ratna</samp> for his prestigious work.</p>
